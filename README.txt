Why did the chicken cross the road? He was afraid of the Python!!!! (My final bad joke)

So this is my amazing Blackjack game. Honestly, I didn't get to finish it yet.
I wanted to add a function where you could pick the value of an Ace to be either
1 or 11 but due to time constraints I wasn't able to accomplish it. Once you launch
the application it will go full screen and the only way to exit the game is to click
"No" in the pop-up window. Like I said in my presentation, I wanted to include images,
which I did. It was fun taking what I learned in Java and applying it in another
language. Also, you might notice that when you click yes on the pop-up window there is
a weird screen flash. That is because I have a while loop going that basically restarts
my entire application.

!!!!!Also, you're going to need to download Python 3. If you run this on Python 2 it won't run!!!!!

Other than that, it plays like normal Blackjack
